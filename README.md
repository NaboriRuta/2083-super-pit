# 2083-super-pit
Introducing the Team Blitz 2083 Super Pit! Everything here is made for cutting and building DIY-style.

### Some important things to note:
- Parts modeled can all be found at [The DIY Road Cases Store](https://diyroadcasesstore.com)
  - Some dimensions weren't included, but everything is as accurate as possible
- The plywood our team used is 15/32" thick
- Dimensions are rounded down to the nearest 1/16"
  - If that wasn't the case, then dimensions would be going to decimals
