# 2083-super-pit
Introducing the Team Blitz 2083 Super Pit! Everything here is made for cutting and building DIY-style.

## Some important things to note:
- Parts modeled can all be found at [The DIY Road Cases Store](https://diyroadcasesstore.com)
  - Some dimensions weren't included, but everything is as accurate as possible
  - I'd suggest looking at [Penn-Elcom](https://penn-elcom.com) for more parts, as the DIY Road Cases Store gets basically everything from them
- The plywood our team used is 15/32" thick
- Dimensions are rounded down to the nearest 1/16"
  - If that wasn't the case, then dimensions would be going to decimals

### Quick File Description
- plywood-cut-lists contains a cut list of how the pieces are cut out initially as well as what the finished pieces will end up looking like
- cad-files contains all of the SOLIDWORKS CAD files used
- model-pics contains pictures of the Super Pit for people who don't have SOLIDWORKS on their computer

### For CAD People
- You will notice parts like "Tongue Extrusion Alt 1"
  - These are so the assemblies don't make a bunch of errors when rebuilding
- Some designs were too detail-intensive to do from scratch, so you'll see lots of boxes with the same overall dimensions and the name carved out
- If you zoom in to where the extrusions meet, there will be gaps
  - The small gaps actually makes the extrusions cuttable
